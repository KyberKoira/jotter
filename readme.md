# Jotter

It´s an text editor by Joel, so Joel + Text = Jotter (Thanks ChatGPT!)

## Requirements

- Build tools for C (gcc)
- ncurses

## Installation

- Copy repo
- Run ´bash editor.sh´ to build from source
- symlink bin/jotter to PATH

## Usage

- do `jotter <path-to-file>`
- move with arrow keys
- CTRL-S to save
- CTRL-C to shutdown

## Future

I will most likely be using neovim so this might evolve into something else
than an text editor at some point
